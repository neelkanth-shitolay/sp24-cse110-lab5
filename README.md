***Check your Understanding
1. **Testing the "message" feature**:
   - Yes, unit tests are suitable for testing the "message" feature of a messaging application. In this case, the united test can verify that the message creation, sending, and receiving functionalities work correctly. They can ensure that messages are properly formatted, delivered to the intended recipient, and displayed correctly in the user interface. Additionally, it allos for testing the specifc feature without relying on the entire system's functionality, making them efficient and effective for ensuring the reliability of the messaging feature.

2. **Testing the "max message length" feature**:
   - Yes, unit tests can be used to test the "max message length" feature of a messaging application. In this case, the unit test can verify that the application correctly enforces the maximum message length limit, preventing users from typing more than the allowed number of characters. Unit tests can simulate user input, exceeding and staying within the character limit, and validate that the application behaves as expected in both scenarios. This ensures that the limit is appropriate and helps maintain the application's desired functionality.
